        The <b>Porsche 993</b> is the internal designation for the Porsche 911 model manufactured and sold between
        January 1994 and early 1998 (model years 1995–1998 in the United States), replacing the 964. Its discontinuation
        marked the end of air-cooled 911 models.
        The 993 was much improved over, and quite different from its predecessor. According to Porsche, every part of
        the car was designed from the ground up, including the engine[3] and only 20% of its parts were carried over
        from the previous generation.[4] Porsche refers to the 993 as "a significant advance, not just from a technical,
        but also a visual perspective."[5] Porsche's engineers devised a new light-alloy subframe with coil and wishbone
        suspension (an all new multi-link system), putting behind the previous lift-off oversteer[3] and making
        significant progress with the engine and handling, creating a more civilized car overall providing an improved
        driving experience.[4] The 993 was also the first 911 to receive a six speed transmission.[6]

        The 993 had several variants, as its predecessors, varying in body style, engines, drivetrains and included
        equipment. Power was increased by the addition of the VarioRam system, which added additional power,
        particularly in the mid-ranges, and also resulted in more throttle noise at higher revs; as a consequence,
        resulted in a 15% increase in power over its predecessor.[7]

        The external design of the <b> Porsche 993 </b>, penned by English designer Tony Hatter, retained the basic body
        shell architecture of the 964 and other earlier 911 models, but with revised exterior panels, with much more
        flared wheel arches, a smoother front and rear bumper design, an enlarged retractable rear wing and teardrop
        mirrors.

        A 993 GT2 was used as the safety car during the 1995 Formula One season.[8]

    <h2> <b> 993.GT2 </b> </h2>
    <p>
        The GT2 was the racing version of the 993 Turbo made to compete in the FIA GT2 class racing. By the mid 1990s,
        most of the sanctioning bodies of road racing had placed severe limitations, if not outright bans on the use
        all-wheel-drive systems, due in part to Audi's earlier success in campaigning their various Quattro cars in
        touring car races around the globe, to Porsche's 959 and its racing version the 961, and in part to the Nissan
        Skyline. It was in this atmosphere that in order to take their turbo-engined 993 racing, Porsche developed the
        rear drive GT. The deletion of the all-wheel-drive drivetrain also brought with it the benefit of significant
        weight savings to the competition car. To qualify the car for racing, a limited number of street legal variants
        were created for homologation purposes, which are now highly prized and valued by collectors. The interior
        treatment of the GT2 is similar to that of the sibling Carrera RS. Exterior wise, the fenders of the Turbo have
        been cut back and replaced with bolt-on plastic pieces in order to accommodate large racing tyres and to help
        ease the repairs of damage to the fenders that are an often reoccurring event in auto racing.[30]

        Until 1997, the street legal version of GT2 racecar, named GT had almost the same engine as the Turbo, but
        operated with higher boost pressure and generated a maximum power output of 430 PS (316 kW; 424 hp). In 1998
        model year, a twin ignition system was added; power was raised to 450 PS (331 kW; 444 hp) at 6,000 rpm and 586
        N⋅m (432 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 3,500 rpm. Only 57 road legal variants were built.[31]

        The racing variants have different engine set-ups depending on the applicable racing series. By 1996, the
        factory-quoted power rating was 456 PS (335 kW; 450 hp) at 5,700 rpm and torque of 670 N⋅m (494 lb⋅ft) of torque
        at 5,000 rpm. Power output came as high as 600 PS (441 kW; 592 hp) in an "Evo" version designed for the
        GT1-series of which only 11 cars were built before it was ultimately replaced by the mid-engine 911 GT1.[32]

        Additionally, the rear deck lid of the street legal version of the GT2 will also sport "911 GT" instead of "911
        GT2".
