        The racing variants have different engine set-ups depending on the applicable racing series. By 1996, the
        factory-quoted power rating was 456 PS (335 kW; 450 hp) at 5,700 rpm and torque of 670 N⋅m (494 lb⋅ft) of torque
        at 5,000 rpm. Power output came as high as 600 PS (441 kW; 592 hp) in an "Evo" version designed for the
        GT1-series of which only 11 cars were built before it was ultimately replaced by the mid-engine 911 GT1.[32].
